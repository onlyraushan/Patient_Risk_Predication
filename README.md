# Patient Risk Prediction project in the Healthcare Analytics domain

This project aims to predict health risks for patients using large-scale medical data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), lab results, demographics, and insurance claims. By analyzing this data, the system can identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious conditions or being readmitted to the hospital.
