# Patient Risk Prediction project in the Healthcare Analytics domain

This project aims to predict health risks for patients using large-scale medical data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), lab results, demographics, and insurance claims. By analyzing this data, the system can identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious conditions or being readmitted to the hospital.

Step-by-Step Project Plan
1. Understand the Problem Statement
•	Goal: Predict patients at high risk of chronic diseases.
•	Data Sources: EMR (Electronic Medical Records), lab test results, and unstructured clinical notes.
•	Outcome: A risk score or classification (e.g., high-risk vs. low-risk).
________________________________________
2. Data Collection & Exploration
•	Structured Data: EMR tables (patient demographics, diagnosis codes, lab results).
•	Unstructured Data: Doctor's notes, discharge summaries (to be stored in MongoDB).
•	Action:
•	Load structured data into PostgreSQL.
•	Load unstructured notes into MongoDB.
•	Explore data for missing values, outliers, and distributions.
________________________________________
3. Data Modelling (Star Schema)
•	Fact Table: fact_patient_risk
•	Dimension Tables:
•	dim_patient – patient demographics
•	dim_hospital – hospital info
•	dim_diagnosis – diagnosis codes and descriptions
•	Action:
•	Design schema in PostgreSQL.
•	Use foreign keys to link dimensions to the fact table.
________________________________________
4. Data Preprocessing with Spark
•	Use Spark (Scala or Python) to:
•	Clean and normalize lab test results.
•	Encode categorical variables.
•	Handle missing values.
•	Extract features from unstructured notes (e.g., using NLP techniques like TF-IDF or embeddings).
________________________________________
5. Feature Engineering
•	Examples:
•	Age, gender, BMI
•	Lab test trends (e.g., increasing glucose levels)
•	Diagnosis history (e.g., number of chronic conditions)
•	NLP features from notes (e.g., mentions of symptoms)
________________________________________
6. Model Building with MLlib
•	Use Logistic Regression from MLlib:
•	Train model on labelled data (e.g., patients with known chronic conditions).
•	Evaluate using metrics like AUC, precision, recall.
•	Tune hyperparameters if needed.
________________________________________
7. Risk Scoring & Prediction
•	Generate risk scores for each patient.
•	Store predictions in fact_patient_risk table.
•	Optionally, visualize results using dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
________________________________________
8. Deployment & Monitoring
•	Deploy model as a Spark job or REST API.
•	Schedule regular updates (e.g., weekly risk scoring).
•	Monitor model performance and data drift.

Business View
To understand what’s in the business view of your Patient Risk Prediction project, let’s break it down from a business perspective rather than a technical one. A business view focuses on what value the project delivers, who benefits, and how decisions are supported.

Business View of Patient Risk Prediction
Objective
Identify patients who are at high risk of chronic diseases (like diabetes, heart disease, etc.) early, so that healthcare providers can take preventive actions.



Stakeholders
•	Doctors & Clinicians: Get alerts about high-risk patients for early intervention.
•	Hospital Management: Optimize resource allocation and reduce long-term treatment costs.
•	Insurance Companies: Assess risk profiles for better policy planning.
•	Patients: Receive timely care and lifestyle guidance.
________________________________________
Key Business Metrics
•	% of high-risk patients correctly identified
•	Reduction in hospital readmissions
•	Improvement in patient outcomes (e.g., controlled blood sugar levels)
•	Cost savings from preventive care
________________________________________
Insights Delivered
•	Risk scores for each patient
•	Trends in lab results indicating worsening conditions
•	Diagnosis patterns linked to chronic diseases
•	NLP-based alerts from doctor notes (e.g., mentions of fatigue, chest pain)
________________________________________
Data Sources in Business Terms
•	EMR Data: Patient history, demographics, diagnosis codes
•	Lab Tests: Blood sugar, cholesterol, etc.
•	Clinical Notes: Doctor observations, symptoms (unstructured)
________________________________________
Use Cases
•	Preventive Care Programs: Targeted outreach to high-risk patients
•	Clinical Decision Support: Flagging patients during visits
•	Population Health Management: Understanding disease trends across regions
________________________________________
Business Value
•	Proactive healthcare instead of reactive treatment
•	Reduced costs for hospitals and insurers
•	Better patient satisfaction and outcomes
•	Data-driven decisions for healthcare planning
